    <h2>What is Squash?</h2>

    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.worldsquash.org/">World Squash Federation</a>, squash has been around since 1830. The game originated from an older game called "rackets," which was played in London's prisons in the 18th century. Later, students at The Harrow School outside London discovered that a punctured ball played the same way made the game even more exciting. The first squash players used punctured rubber balls, which, when hit, squashed against the walls (hence the name "squash").</p>
    <p>Today, squash is played in the confinement of four walls between two players, each holding a racquet to strike a rubber ball against the front wall. The sport has gained popularity around the world and is now played in over 185 countries. Some professional tournaments are held at spectacular venues such as the Pyramids of Giza, Grand Central Station in New York City, and the Shanghai waterfront in China.</p>

    <h2>Gear</h2>
    <p>Squash Racquet - There are many different brands and weights of racquets. Try out different ones before you find the racquet that works for you!</p>
    <p>Squash Goggles - It is important to protect your eyes from potential stray balls and racquets.</p>
    <p>Squash Shoes - Shoes with special rubber non-marking soles are used on the squash court. Similar shoes are used in badminton and indoor voleyball. It is important not to wear these shoes off court, because you could bring dirt or liquid onto the court.</p>
    <p>Squash Ball - Squash balls come in <a href="https://www.squashpoint.com/blogs/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-squash-ball/">different bounces and colors</a>. The red and blue dot balls are much bouncier and great for beginners. Double yellow dot balls are much slower and are typically used during competitive matches and tournaments.</p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p> 
    <ul>
      <li>At the start of a match, one player spins a racquet to decide who will serve first. The winner picks which service box to serve from.</li>
      <li>Each rally starts with a serve, and the players then return the ball alternately until the rally ends. The ball must hit the front wall but can hit the side and back walls as well.</li>
      <li>The opponent must hit the ball before the ball bounces twice (double bounce).</li>
      <li>Every time you win a rally, you get a point.</li>
      <li>A player can also select which box to serve from at the beginning of each game and after the ball has been handed over (hand out). If the same player wins the point, they must now serve from the alternate box.</li>
      <li>The first player to earn 11 points wins the game.</li>
      <li>The first player to earn 3 games wins the match.</li>
      <li>If there is a tie at 10-10 in a game, players must continue unti one player leads by two points.</li>

   <img src="https://squashclub.org/main/e-lessons/lessons/beginner_lessons/images/squash_court.jpg"
     alt="Squash court diagram">
    <p> 
    <ul>
      <li>Move back to the T as fast as you can after every shot</li>
      <li>Keep your eye on the ball.</li>
      <li>Move your opponents off the T (out of position).</li>
      <li>Hit 80% of your shots <a href="https://squashclub.org/main/e-lessons/shots/shots.shtml">straight</a> (parallel to the side wall).</li>
      <li>Take time on your serve and try to hit the side wall.</li>
      <li>Focus on ONE point at a time.</li>
      <li>Never assume your shot is a winner and always be prepared for your opponent to retrieve it.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

<h3>What You Can Do to Improve</h3>
<p> 
    <ul>
      <li>Practice
        <ul>
          <li>Whether you're practicing alone or with your coach, repetition and discipline are how you get better! Drills are used to practice all of your skills, from serves to volleys! Another way to practice is by playing with other people. Ask some friends to get on court and play a few games with you! Remember: You only get out what you put in.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Challenge Yourself!
        <ul>
          <li>See how many shots you can hit against the wall in a row!</li>

     alt="Squash ghosting">
        <ul>
          <li>Practice getting to the four corners and back to the T without a ball. This is called <a href="https://sportscentaur.com/the-complete-guide-to-squash-ghosting-drills/">"ghosting"</a>. It will help prepare you for a match when you need to retrieve all of your opponent's shots while staying in a position to control the rally.</li>
